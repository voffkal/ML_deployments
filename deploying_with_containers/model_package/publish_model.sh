# Build the model package and publish the wheel as a GitHub Release asset.
#
# The course used a private Gemfury index for this. GitHub Releases does the
# same job for free: the wheel is a versioned, downloadable artifact, and the
# API installs it as an ordinary pinned dependency. What is published is the
# package built from THIS commit, so the release tag, the package version and
# the trained model inside it all line up.
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated via GH_TOKEN), python with build installed.
# Usage:    ./publish_model.sh .
